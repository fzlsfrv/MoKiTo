/scratch/htc/fsafarov/openmm_ff/lib/python3.12/site-packages/MDAnalysis/coordinates/DCD.py:165: DeprecationWarning: DCDReader currently makes independent timesteps by copying self.ts while other readers update self.ts inplace. This behavior will be changed in 3.0 to be the same as other readers. Read more at https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/3889 to learn if this change in behavior might affect you.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 51.47 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 39.39 GiB of which 38.39 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1018.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 528.00 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 0 bytes is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
